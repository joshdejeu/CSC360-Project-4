        Project #4: Process Synchronization Using Pthreads: The Producer / Consumer Problem With Prime Number Detector
        <br /><br />

    </b>

    <div style="border-bottom:solid windowtext .75pt;"> </div>

    <p><b>OBJECTIVE</b></p>

    <p>The purpose of this programming project is to explore process synchronization.&#160; This will be accomplished by
        writing a simulation to the Producer / Consumer problem described below.&#160; Your simulation will be
        implemented using Pthreads.&#160; Tutorials on the Pthread functions and their usage can be found in our text,
        in our notes, or online.&#160; This simulation is a modification to the programming project found at the end of
        Chapter 6 and most of the text of this project specification is directly from that project description. Name the
        program osproj4.cpp or osproj4.c and the executable as osproj4.</p>
    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><b>THE PRODUCER / CONSUMER PROBLEM</b></p>
    <p>In Chapter 3, we developed a model of a system consisting of cooperating sequential processes or threads, all
        running asynchronously and possibly sharing data.&#160; We illustrated this model with the producer - consumer
        problem, which is representative of operating systems.&#160; Specifically, we discussed how a &quot;bounded
        buffer&quot; could be used to enable processes to share memory.
    <p>In Chapter 3, we described a technique using a circular buffer that can hold BUFFER_SIZE-1 items.&#160; By using
        a shared memory location count, the buffer can hold all BUFFER_SIZE items.&#160; This count is initialized to 0
        and is incremented every time an item is placed into the buffer and decremented every time an item is removed
        from the buffer.&#160; The count data item can also be implemented as a counting semaphore.</p>
    <p>The producer can place items into the buffer only if the buffer has a free memory location to store the
        item.&#160; The producer cannot add items to a full buffer.&#160; The consumer can remove items from the buffer
        if the buffer is not empty.&#160; The consumer must wait to consume items if the buffer is empty.</p>
    <p>The &quot;items&quot; stored in this buffer will be integers.&#160; Your producer process will have to insert
        random numbers into the buffer.&#160; The consumer process will consume a number and detect if the number is
        prime.</p>
    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><b>PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS</b></p>
    The buffer used between producer and consumer processes will consist of a fixed-size array of type
    buffer_item.&#160; The queue of buffer_item objects will be manipulated using a circular array.&#160; The buffer
    will be manipulated with two functions, buffer_insert_item() and buffer_remove_item(), which are called by the
    producer and consumer threads, respectively.&#160; A skeleton outlining these function can be found in
    <a rel="noopener" href="buffer.h">buffer.h</a>.
    <p>The buffer_insert_item() and buffer_remove_item() functions will synchronize the producer and consumer using the
        algorithms similar to those in Slide 34 and 35 of <u>ch5_v01 Process Sync.pptx</u>.&#160; The buffer will also
        require an initialization function (not supplied in buffer.h) that initializes the mutual exclusion object
        &quot;mutex&quot; along with the &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;full&quot; semaphores.</p>
    <p>The producer thread will alternate between sleeping for a random period of time and generating and inserting
        (trying to) an integer into the buffer.&#160; Random numbers will be generated using the rand_r()
        function.&#160; The sleep function used must be a &quot;thread safe&quot; sleep function.&#160; See the code
        listed below for an overview of the producer algorithm.</p>
    <p>The consumer thread will alternate between sleeping for a random period of time (thread safe of course) and
        (trying to) removing a number out of the buffer.&#160; The number removed will then be verified if it is
        prime.&#160; See the code listed below for an overview of the consumer algorithm.</p>
    <pre>
      #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;  /* required for rand() */
      #include &quot;buffer.h&quot;
      void *producer(void *param)
      {
        buffer_item rand;
        while(1)
        {
          /* sleep for a random period of time */
          sleep(...);
          /* generate a random number */
          rand = rand();
          printf(&quot;producer produced %f\n&quot;, rand);
          if(insert_item(rand))
            /* report error condition */
        }
      }
      void *consumer(void *param)
      {
        buffer_item rand;
        while(1)
        {
          /* sleep for a random period of time */
          sleep(...);
          printf(&quot;producer produced %f\n&quot;, rand);
          if(remove_item(&amp;rand))
            /* report error condition */
          else
            printf(&quot;consumer consumed %d \n&quot;, rand);
        }
      }
      </pre>


    <p>The main function will initialize the buffer and create the separate producer and consumer threads.&#160; Once it
        has created the producer and consumer threads, the main() function will sleep (thread safe) for duration of the
        simulation.&#160; Upon awakening, the main thread will signal other threads to quit by setting a simulation flag
        which is a global variable.&#160; The main thread will join with the other threads and then display the
        simulation statistics. The main() function will be passed five parameters on the command line:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The length of time the main thread is to sleep before terminating (simulation length in seconds)</li>
        <li>The maximum length of time the producer and consumer threads will sleep prior to producing or consuming a
            buffer_item</li>
        <li>The number of producer threads</li>
        <li>The number of consumer threads</li>
        <li>A &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to output the individual buffer snapshots for each item produced and
            consumed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A skeleton for the main function appears as:</p>

    <pre>
    #include &quot;buffer.h&quot;
    int main( int argc, char *argv[] )
    {
      Get command line arguments
      Initialize buffer
      Create producer thread(s)
      Create consumer thread(s)
      Sleep
      Join Threads
      Display Statistics
      Exit
    }
    </pre>

    <p>Creating Pthreads using the Pthreads API is discussed in Chapter 4 and in supplemental notes provided
        online.&#160; Please refer to those references for specific instructions regarding creation of the producer and
        consumer Pthreads.</p>
    <p>The following code sample illustrates how mutex locks available in the Pthread API can be used to protect a
        critical section:</p>
    <p>

    <pre>
    #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
    
    pthread_mutex_t mutex;
    
    /* create the mutex lock */
    pthread_mutex_init( &amp;mutex, NULL );
    
    /* aquire the mutex lock */
    pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;mutex );
    
    /*** CRITICAL SECTION ***/
    
    /* release the mutex lock */ 
    pthread_mutex_unlock( &amp;mutex );
    </pre>

    <p>Pthreads uses the pthread_mutex_t data type for mutex locks.&#160; A mutex is created with the
        pthread_mutex_init() function, with the first parameter being a pointer to the mutex.&#160; By passing NULL as a
        second parameter, we initialize the mutex to its default attributes.&#160; The mutex is acquired and released
        with the pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() functions.&#160; If the mutex lock is unavailable when
        pthread_mutex_lock() is invoked, the calling thread is blocked until the owner invokes
        pthread_mutex_unlock().&#160; All mutex functions return a value of 0 with correct operaton; if an error occurs,
        these functions return a nonzero error code.</p>
    <p>Pthreads provides two types of semaphores: named and unnamed.&#160; For this project, we will use unnamed
        semaphores.&#160; The code below illustrates how a semaphore is created:</p>
    <p>

    <pre>
    #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;
    sem_t sem;
    
    /* create the semaphore and initialize it to 5 */
    sem_init( &amp;sem, 0, 5 );
    </pre>

    <p>The sem_init() function creates and initializes a semaphore.&#160; This function is passed three
        parameters:&#160; A pointer to the semaphore, a flag indicating the level of sharing, and the semaphore&#39;s
        initial value.&#160; In this example, by passing the flag 0, we are indicating that this semaphore can only be
        shared by threads belonging to the same process that created the semaphore.&#160; A nonzero value would allow
        other processes to access the semaphore as well.&#160; In this example, we initialize the semaphore to the value
        5.</p>
    <p>In attahced slides for Chapter 5 Process Synchronization, we described the classical wait() and signal()
        semaphore operations.&#160; Pthread names the wait() and signal() operations sem_wait() and sem_post(),
        respectively.&#160; The code example below creates a binary semaphore mutex with an initial value 1 and
        illustrates it use in protecting a critical section:</p>
    <p>

    <pre>
    #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;
    
    sem_t mutex;
    
    /* create the semaphore */
    sem_init( &amp;mutex, 0, 1 );
    
    /* acquire the semaphore */
    sem_wait( &amp;mutex );
    
    /*** CRITICAL SECTION ***/
    
    /* release the semaphore */
    sem_post( &amp;mutex );
    </pre>
    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><b>PROGRAM OUTPUT</b></p>
    Output for this simulation is critical to verify that your simulation program is working correctly.&#160; Use this
    sample as to determine what your simulation should output when various conditions occur (buffer empty/full, location
    of next producer/consumer, etc.)&#160; Your program output format should be identical to the following:
